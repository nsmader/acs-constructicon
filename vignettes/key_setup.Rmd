You can request a key at the US Census Bureau's [key signup page](http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).
All you need is an organization name and email address.
And, after you agree to the terms of service and submit the form, your key will be emailed to you.
When you receive the API key in an email, all that's left is to click the link active the key.

Now, you should have a key that looks something like `c009d1d366fe5077a7266212f3205b7715745441`.
Use either the `enter_api_key` or `load_api_key` method to install your new key.
The former will prompt you to type in (or copy-and-paste) the key.
The latter will read the key from a file.

For example, in a if you store your key in `Key.txt`, you can test and optionally load in a script with

```r
if (!have_api_key()) {
    load_api_key("Key.txt")
}
```

Or, if using during an interactive session, try

```r
> enter_api_key()
Enter API key: c009d1d366fe5077a7266212f3205b7715745441
```
