ACS tables have implicit hierarchy which relates fields to nested concepts.
This is an attempt to provide means to easily query for collections of interrelated fields.

*What is the total number of children under 18 related to a householder?*

```r
acs_sum(universe == RelChiUnder18)
```

*How many children live in a household with income over previous 12 months below poverty level?*

```r
acs_sum(universe == RelChiUnder18,
        income < poverty)
```

```r
acs_sum(universe == RelChiUnder18,
        income < poverty,
        family == FamMar)
acs_sum(universe == RelChiUnder18,
        income < poverty,
        family == FamMar,
        age == ALt5)
acs_sum(universe == RelChiUnder18,
        income < poverty,
        family == FamMar,
        age == A5)
acs_sum(universe == RelChiUnder18,
        income < poverty,
        family == FamMar,
